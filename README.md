# Airlines-Dashboard

## Problem Statement

The airline industry operates in a dynamic environment, influenced by geographic factors, passenger demand, and operational constraints. In order to optimize performance and ensure competitive advantage, it is essential to monitor and analyze key metrics such as the count of operating airlines, regional passenger distribution, and year-over-year trends in published airlines.

This dashboard aims to address the following key areas:

#### Airline Operations by Geographic Region:

What is the current distribution of operating airlines across various geographic regions?

How has the count of operating airlines changed across regions (increased, decreased, or remained stable)?

#### Passenger Volume Analysis:

How is the passenger volume distributed across different regions, and which regions contribute the most to the total adjusted passenger count?

#### Industry Trends and Growth:

How has the number of published airlines evolved over the years, and which regions have seen the most growth or decline in airline operations?

#### Actionable Insights:

What strategic decisions can be made based on the regional distribution of airlines and passenger count to improve efficiency and profitability?

# Insights

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;
#### Passenger Volume by Region:

i) Asia leads in terms of adjusted passenger count with over 44 million passengers, making it the largest contributor to global passenger traffic.

ii) Europe and Australia/Oceania also show substantial passenger volumes, highlighting their significance in global airline operations.

iii) Regions like the Middle East and Central America contribute smaller portions to the overall passenger count, indicating potential for growth or reflecting less air traffic compared to other regions.

#### Operating Airline Count by Region:

i) The dashboard indicates that the US has the highest number of operating airlines, followed by Asia and Europe.

ii) Other regions like Canada and Mexico have significantly fewer operating airlines, signaling possible regional concentration or market saturation in those areas.

#### Published Airline Count by Year:

i) There is a noticeable fluctuation in the number of published airlines over the years. For instance, 2006 and 2012 had the highest count of published airlines, whereas 2016 and 2015 had fewer.

ii) The dashboard could suggest key events or trends during these years that influenced the airline industry's growth or contraction.

#### Regional Distribution of Published Airlines:

i) The US dominates in terms of published airlines, accounting for the majority of the pie chart (38.63%). Asia and Europe also show strong representation in published airlines.

ii) Canada, Mexico, and Australia/Oceania have smaller portions, indicating that these regions have fewer airlines operating on a large scale.

#### Operational Changes (Increase/Decrease):

i) The bar chart showing the count of operating airlines across regions (and changes) indicates that most regions have stable operations with slight increases or decreases. This stability may suggest that the airline industry in these regions is relatively mature, with limited new entries or exits.

#### Strategic Opportunity:

i) Regions like the Middle East, Mexico, and Central America show lower passenger counts and fewer operating airlines compared to regions like Asia or the US. These regions could present opportunities for airline expansion or increased passenger service.

ii) Europe and Asia maintain strong passenger volumes and airline operations, suggesting a competitive yet stable environment where airlines could benefit from optimizing operations rather than expanding.

#### In summary, the dashboard highlights Asia, the US, and Europe as key markets with high passenger volumes and operational airline counts, while other regions such as Mexico, Canada, and the Middle East have room for potential growth and expansion.
